The Best AI Prompts for Finance & Financial Reporting

Artificial intelligence (AI) has for the past decade helped companies quickly and efficiently prepare financial reports, check for errors, and even transmit SEC filings. Increasingly, companies want to incorporate more AI in financial reporting but may need help getting started. While AI-focused enterprise solutions are available, some companies are asking if using the popular Open AI’s ChatGPT tool for financial reports is a good option. Indeed — ChatGPT does have merit for this task. AI tools such as ChatGPT work best when instructed to work on one step at a time. Rather than assign ChatGPT the task of creating a complete financial report from scratch, ask it to work on a small part of the task before moving to the next. Also, it’s important always to review results for accuracy.

Here are some tips and suggested prompts to test out:

Tip 1: Summarize Financial Data

ChatGPT is skilled at ingesting and parsing large data sets. You can upload reports to the paid version of ChatGPT and ask it to summarize key findings. Choose to have key results formatted in a table using rows and columns you label or ask for an overview paragraph if you prefer a narrative summary.

Tip 2: Analyze Trends and Performance

ChatGPT can review data, pick out trends, and apply logic to trends and performance data. Ask ChatGPT to answer various questions from the data set without additional research. Or request a data visualization to accompany the report. ChatGPT cannot produce or predict future performance based on financial data.

Tip 3: Draft Financial Disclosure Notes

Tools like ChatGPT modify templates well to reflect new and updated information. For example, you can train the AI with financial disclosure notes from another report. Then, ask it to create draft financial disclosure notes using the template with new and updated information. Assuming there are no new regulations, the draft financial disclosure notes should reflect updated compliance needs, saving time.

Tip 4: Optimize Internal Audits

With training, ChatGPT can identify anomalies, flag potential errors and omissions, and verify accuracy and completeness. Using ChatGPT in the audit process allows companies to quickly parse extensive reports and hone in on areas that need attention, saving time and improving accuracy.
